## Synopsis
This project aims to create a library that translates between GA4GH Cloud API schemas and RO-Crate profiles to facilitate reproducibility in scientific research. The tool will enable the packaging and sharing of task/tool and workflow runs, allowing other researchers to reproduce them or use parts of them.

## Description
The WRROC <> GA4GH API Conversion Tool is designed to compile RO-Crates from tool and workflow executions in GA4GH Cloud API-powered cloud infrastructures. This will allow easy re-execution of these computational analyses, thus improving the reporting and reproducibility of computational research.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
